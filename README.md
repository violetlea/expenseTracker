Expense Tracker App

For someone who always try to budget her monthly expenses, I realized that it's quite annoying that I have to write up on notes of my budgets and use a calculator to calculate the total of my monthly expenses. So I decided to create this app to make me easier to calculate my total expenses accurately. This is just a frontend project only and can be scalable to backend where user can have more than 1 expenses and compare their expenses. This app can be an everyday expense tracker app, and user can check their daily expenses.

Tech stack:
1. React + VITE
2. Redux Toolkit
